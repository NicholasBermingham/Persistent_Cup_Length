# Persistent_Cup_Length

Here is an implementation of the algorithm from "Persistent cup-length" by Contessoto M, MÃ©moli F, Stefanou A and Zhou L https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01553 to calculate the persistent-cup length of a simplicial complex using the oineus package by Arnur Nigmetov https://github.com/anigmetov/oineus to get the persistent cohomology barcodes and their representative cocycles. This implementation is currently very sub-optimal and will require edits going forward to improve its efficiency. There may also be potential bugs that have not yet been identified through the testing that has been done up until this point.
